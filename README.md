# Neural-Network
I am following through Michael Nielsen's online book, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", synthesising it and approaching from a more mathematical angle. The PDF will include a mathematical understanding of all the steps and some exercises from the book, and include all of the python programmes contained in this repo (and some not included) but in a far more logical order, so I suggest reading this before looking at the code directly.
